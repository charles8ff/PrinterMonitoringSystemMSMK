## Technologies Applied

```bash
echo hello world
```

## Branches Usage

There are 2 branches in this project, the __*main*__ branch will carry the README.md updates and the merging updates from the __*dev*__ branch, where new functionalities will be implemented.

The standard procedure will always be to merge main into dev first to avoid possible conflicts, fix them in the axuliar branch and thus keeping branch main clean.

## Credits

I have used the Python Documentation about [Logging Handlers](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#useful-handlers) in order to overload some methods about the __*BaseRotatingHandler()*__
